# Polars Murder Mysteries

The goal is to develop a series of murder mysteries (in a cozy crime novel style) that help to learn the features of the polars package for data analysis.

The murder mysteries should be hosted in an online notebook environment. Candidates are Google Colab or sth like Jupyterlite (see [here](https://jtp.io/jupytercon-2023-jupyterlite/files/index.html#1)) or Marimo. It's necessary to have Polars pre-installed and to be able to load static files (the notebooks).

The project is inspired by SQL Murder Mysteries: <https://mystery.knightlab.com/>

## Naming Ideas 

for a project that eventually spans multiple data analysis languages

* Database Detectives
* Dataframe Detectives
* Dataset Detectives

## Cases based on Claude

Death at the Aurora Theater

- police record database
    - type: murder
    - location: theater
    - date: yesterday (relative date vs. user date?)
    - => case id
- Witness Reports
    - case id
    - witness name
    - testimony
    => saw crime from different angles 
- stage access
    - date
    - location
    - member id
- staff database
    - member id
    - staff name
    - staff role
- ticket database: not needed, full fake data
- theater review archives for different actors: not needed, full fake data

## Prompts with ChatGPT

> I want to create exercises for learning the "polars" library for data analysis based on fictious data-driven murder mysteries. Every mystery can be solved by analysing dataframes and joining them to find subsets of interest (e.g. a list of license plates that were seen at a certain time and a database of the owners of the respective cars). I want to develop small, slightly whimsical murder mysteries in the style of cozy crime novels. They should use polar bears as protagonists.
> Please help me brainstorm 10 ideas for such murder mysteries. For each idea, also suggest potential cases for dataframes that have data linked to the respective case. 

Here are 10 whimsical murder mystery ideas featuring polar bears, each tied to potential dataframes for analysis:

---

### 10. **The Case of the Singing Iceberg**
**Plot**: An iceberg choirâ€™s lead singer goes missing on performance night, replaced by an imposter.
**Dataframes**:
- **Choir Roster**: Singer IDs and parts sung.
- **Attendance Logs**: Arrival times for rehearsal and performance.
- **Transport Records**: Vehicles used and driver IDs.

Would you like to expand on any of these ideas or brainstorm more specific dataframe structures?

> Please develop the first case ("The Case of the Missing Iceberg") into a full mystery including:

> - an introduction to the reader
> - an overview of the tables for the reader
> - a culprit with a motive
> - polars code to create the different dataframes. there should be at least 100 potential suspects in the tables to avoid brute-force attempts.
> - a function where the reader can suggest a suspect and the function verifies whether the suspect is indeed the culprit

> (NOTE TO SELF: The script below does not really offer any logic why a specific suspect is indeed the culprit. Will require some additional prompting to generate code that captures this.)

# The Case of the Missing Iceberg
# Introduction:
# Late one evening, Dr. Ursula Polar, a renowned glaciologist, discovers her research iceberg (ID: "GLC-042") has vanished from its designated GPS coordinates. This iceberg was crucial to her climate study, and its disappearance threatens months of work. 
# Can you help solve the mystery by analyzing the provided data tables?
